    <h1>Piracy and Streaming</h1>
    <div>
      <p><em>Pirate.</em> When someone thinks of the word, no longer are they thinking about a bearded man with a sword and an eye patch. The word has taken on a whole new meaning in today’s society and is now a term we use to refer to someone who distributes or uses content gathered illegally. Virtual goods such as movies, music, games and even books are <em>pirated</em> on a day to day basis and online communities thrive off the distribution of ‘stolen’ and copied goods. Governments and law makers have yet to crack down fully on pirating; we live in an age where there is still a huge disconnect between policy and technology. Old laws are still in effect and have yet to catch up to the current technological times. </p>

    <h3>Behind the times</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Existing pirating laws are at the point where they are starting to catch up... very slowly. However they are still behind the technological times. Old laws are based on distribution of content via physical media. But no longer are CDs and DVDs the choice for media distribution. They may still exist, but no one that I know still owns a walkman or uses a VHS/DVD player on a regular basis. Most people are downloading their content. Whether it be through Netflix, torrents or other services.  </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Platform Specificity</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Piracy laws were created to protect creators income stream. If consumers aren't paying for the digital goods, the creators don't get paid. However, pay to use sources have become the mainstream sources for movies and tv shows. Movies and tv shows are beginning to skip the box office or tv release and are going straight to online platforms. These online platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO Go etc, are all paid services that a user needs to be subscribe to for a monthly fee. Movies and Tv shows are being created specifically for a platforms audiences but that comes at the cost of limiting access to outsiders. As a result, piracy becomes the only means by which a consumer can access that content besides subscribing to that service. Due to all of the different services now, in order to have access to a specific show. A user will need to be dishing out money to service upon service, in order to watch the exclusive shows.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>How much money is enough money?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Providers need to give a way for users to anonymously provide money based on their enjoyment of the content. Personally, If I go to a movie theatre and HATE the movie, im talking about you Transformers: Last Knight…, I’ve given the movie makers $10-$15 already for the movie. Should it not be considered payment enough If I want to, god forbid, see the movie again? I don’t want to go buy it, it wasn’t good enough for that. However, if I’d like to see it again, streaming or downloading the content should not be considered legal if I have, somewhere along the way, given money to the company in question for that piece of media. When conversations happen about the cost of media, company’s always tend to say the same thing. "We remain committed to combatting piracy and ensuring consumers have reliable, affordable options to access the content they enjoy." <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/868360/Kodi-Box-UK-Block-Ban-Arrest-Coalition-Against-Piracy">(Express.co.uk article)</a></p>

    <h3>Change where the money comes from.</h3>
    <div>
      <p></p>
    </div>
    <h3>Using another medium.</h3>
    <div>
      <p>According to Derbyshite Council Trading Standards board in the UK: “Accessing premium paid-for content without a subscription is considered by the industry as unlawful access, although streaming something online, rather than downloading a file, is likely to be exempt from copyright laws.” (<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/streaming-pirate-content-isnt-illegal-uk-trading-standards-says-170306/">source</a>).</p>
      <p>Downloading/Streaming content should be considered legal if you the consumer, are already paying for a legitimate source that provides the content. Before Netflix or Amazon began to allow for offline downloading. When someone would go on a trip, they wouldn’t be able to use their pay to use service to watch content. They would have to resort to other measures like downloading from a non-official source such as
        <abbr title="The Pirate Bay">TPB</abbr> for their offline needs. Should this be considered an illegal action? Downloading a movie file that you have access to when internet services are not available</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Somethings needs to change in order to create proper new Piracy/Streaming laws: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How content is monetized</li>
      <li>The way content is distributed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once all of the above processes are taken care of, we can then create new laws that protect both the creator's IP and income stream, protect consumer while benefiting them both. I suggest the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consumers who have contributed money in some fashion to the content creators for that piece of content or media, (ex movie theatre, tip, movie purchase), can at any time have access to said content no matter the medium (download, streaming etc)</li>
      <li>Explicitly state that actions of distributors of content for the purpose of monetary benefit should be considered illegal. But the purpose of free distribution is not. </li>
    </ul>
