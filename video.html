      <!-- 500 words on how you made the video and special effects -->
      <h2>How it's made. Behind the scenes...</h2>
      <p>
        The video consists of 9 video snippets overall. 8 of these videos were taken on my Nexus6P in 4K resolution. I then scaled them down in hitfilm to be 1080p. The 1 snippet that wasn't taken on my phone was taken on my logitech 1080p webcam. All of the video snippets were converted into a composite snippet so that I could add text and other effects directly to each individual snippet portion as I saw fit. As you can see watching the video, I added text to the first couple videos explaining the relation to the use case of the lighter.
      </p>
      <p>Most of if not all the video snippets have a fade in and a fade out, making the transitions between the snippets clean and concise. There is also a fade in and fade out on the audio files for eachh of the snippets. I also tweaked and manipulated the audio of the snippets to ensure they weren't too loud and wouldn't overpower the background audio. The first video snippet has a light flare effect on the lighter, while I'm showing it off. There is also a color grading on the video snippet in order to make it seem more intense. The second video snippet of the fire and snow also has a little bit of color grading in order to make the colors pop a bit.</p>
      <p>
        The background audio is a song by Emiljo A.C on soundcloud called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/emiljoacmusic/emiljo-ac-its-a-new-life">It's a new life</a>, I heard it while watching a streamer on twitch and just thought it was perfect. It is open to use and download for commercial purposes so that was a bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really tried my best to make it so the transitions between the videos coincided with a part of the song, just to add to the flow of the video. Some places I should have probably cut down some of the video to make the flow even better, but I'm pretty happy with it overall anywho.

      <!-- Another 500 words explaining your campaign idea -->
      <h2>The Campaign/Crowdfund idea</h2>
      <p>I was actually pretty stumped on what to make a video for. Originally I was thinking of maybe making a video for a piece of software I've been working on during my spare time. <a target="_blank" href="fyrespark.com">FyreSpark.com</a>.However, that idea was snuffed out quickly due to all the school work going on and the task of actually putting the project public and accessible, on top of ensuring I had enough working features to show was way too much of a daunting one. So instead, I was looking around my desk and just picked an item and ended up choosing a <em>BIC Lighter.</em> </p>
      <p>For the lighter campaign I wanted to show some of the functionalities and use cases of the lighter while keeping the video obviously as a spoof, lets face it, no one is going to want to crowdfund the use of a lighter. Anywho, I found some great <a href="https://soundcloud.com/emiljoacmusic/emiljo-ac-its-a-new-life">music</a> that was free to use as a background music and keeping with the sillyness, I just made the video to be super lighthearted.
      </p>
      <p>I based the video around the idea that someone would want to possibly buy this `unique` lighter or give me money on a monthly basis to release videos of me using the lighter. Lets face it, people have done sillyer things on the internet...</p>
      <p>The only issue I really encountered is that I did find the final portion where I was talking to be a bit slow, I could have expanded on it a little by adding some floating text showing facts that I was saying withh some animations spice things up a bit. But I decided against it due to time restrictions. I honestly did not realize video editing takes so long todo! Overall I'm happy with my silly little video and learned a lot.</p>
