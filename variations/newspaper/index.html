            <p>For this task, I used the clone stamp tool in Gimp. I basically cloned sections of the grass and 'painted' over the cat with them. I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8_ge9RxcSw">this</a> tutorial to understand what I needed to do.</p>

            <p>Incomplete. I couldn't get any photos of things to 'average' out. I tried finding some stock photos on the internet but there was nothing. I also only had my phone and was having trouble getting multiple shots perfectly still. I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKoiL6SfDfA">this</a> tutorial so I know how todo it.

I'm really proud of this one.</p>

          <h1>Piracy and Streaming</h1>
          <div>
            <p><em>Pirate.</em> When someone thinks of the word, no longer are they thinking about a bearded man with a sword and an eye patch. The word has taken on a whole new meaning in today’s society and is now a term we use to refer to someone who distributes or uses content gathered illegally. Virtual goods such as movies, music, games and even books are <em>pirated</em> on a day to day basis and online communities thrive off the distribution of ‘stolen’ and copied goods. Governments and law makers have yet to crack down fully on pirating; we live in an age where there is still a huge disconnect between policy and technology. Old laws are still in effect and have yet to catch up to the current technological times. </p>
            <p></p>
            <blockquote cite="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/bills-and-utilities/tv/could-you-be-fined-for-illegally-streaming-movies-or-tv-shows/" title="telegraph.co.uk quote">'Fact says that any site that “makes available or facilitates the availability” of rights-owners’ content without their permission is unlawful.'</blockquote>

          <h3>Behind the times</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Existing pirating laws are at the point where they are starting to catch up... very slowly. However they are still behind the technological times. Old laws are based on distribution of content via physical media. But no longer are CDs and DVDs the choice for media distribution. They may still exist, but no one that I know still owns a walkman or uses a VHS/DVD player on a regular basis. Most people are downloading their content. Whether it be through Netflix, torrents or other services. </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Platform Specificity</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Piracy laws were created to protect creators income stream. If consumers aren't paying for the digital goods, the creators don't get paid. However, pay to use sources have become the mainstream sources for movies and tv shows. Movies and tv shows are beginning to skip the box office or tv release and are going straight to online platforms. These online platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO Go etc, are all paid services that a user needs to be subscribe to for a monthly fee. Movies and Tv shows are being created specifically for a platforms audiences but that comes at the cost of limiting access to outsiders. As a result, piracy becomes the only means by which a consumer can access that content besides subscribing to that service. Due to all of the different services now, in order to have access to a specific show. A user will need to be dishing out money to service upon service, in order to watch the exclusive shows.</p>
          </div>
          <h3>How much money is enough money?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Providers need to give a way for users to anonymously provide money based on their enjoyment of the content. Personally, If I go to a movie theatre and HATE the movie, im talking about you Transformers: Last Knight…, I’ve given the movie makers $10-$15 already for the movie. Should it not be considered payment enough If I want to, god forbid, see the movie again? I don’t want to go buy it, it wasn’t good enough for that. However, if I’d like to see it again, streaming or downloading the content should not be considered legal if I have, somewhere along the way, given money to the company in question for that piece of media. When conversations happen about the cost of media, company’s always tend to say the same thing. "We remain committed to combatting piracy and ensuring consumers have reliable, affordable options to access the content they enjoy." <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/868360/Kodi-Box-UK-Block-Ban-Arrest-Coalition-Against-Piracy">(Express.co.uk article)</a></p>
          </div>
          <h3>Change where the money comes from.</h3>
          <div>
            <p></p>
          </div>
          <h3>Using another medium.</h3>
          <div>
            <p>According to Derbyshite Council Trading Standards board in the UK: “Accessing premium paid-for content without a subscription is considered by the industry as unlawful access, although streaming something online, rather than downloading a file, is likely to be exempt from copyright laws.” (<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/streaming-pirate-content-isnt-illegal-uk-trading-standards-says-170306/">source</a>).</p>
            <p>Downloading/Streaming content should be considered legal if you the consumer, are already paying for a legitimate source that provides the content. Before Netflix or Amazon began to allow for offline downloading. When someone would go on a trip, they wouldn’t be able to use their pay to use service to watch content. They would have to resort to other measures like downloading from a non-official source such as
              <abbr title="The Pirate Bay">TPB</abbr> for their offline needs. Should this be considered an illegal action? Downloading a movie file that you have access to when internet services are not available</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Somethings needs to change in order to create proper new Piracy/Streaming laws: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How content is monetized</li>
            <li>The way content is distributed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once all of the above processes are taken care of, we can then create new laws that protect both the creator's IP and income stream, protect consumer while benefiting them both. I suggest the following: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consumers who have contributed money in some fashion to the content creators for that piece of content or media, (ex movie theatre, tip, movie purchase), can at any time have access to said content no matter the medium (download, streaming etc)</li>
            <li>Explicitly state that actions of distributors of content for the purpose of monetary benefit should be considered illegal. But the purpose of free distribution is not. </li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            <p></p>

          <h2>I'll Never Be The Same - 1937</h2>
          <h3>by: Billy Holiday</h3>
          <h4>Lyrics</h4>
          <pre>
I'll never be the same
Guys have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothin's what it once used to be
And when the song birds that sing
Tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once love was king
But kings can be wrong

I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
I'll never be the same
Since we're apart
But there's a lot that a smile can hide
And I know deep down inside
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again

          <!-- 500 words on how you made the video and special effects -->
          <h2>How it's made. Behind the scenes...</h2>
          <p>
            The video consists of 9 video snippets overall. 8 of these videos were taken on my Nexus6P in 4K resolution. I then scaled them down in hitfilm to be 1080p. The 1 snippet that wasn't taken on my phone was taken on my logitech 1080p webcam. All of the video snippets were converted into a composite snippet so that I could add text and other effects directly to each individual snippet portion as I saw fit. As you can see watching the video, I added text to the first couple videos explaining the relation to the use case of the lighter.
          </p>
          <p>Most of if not all the video snippets have a fade in and a fade out, making the transitions between the snippets clean and concise. There is also a fade in and fade out on the audio files for eachh of the snippets. I also tweaked and manipulated the audio of the snippets to ensure they weren't too loud and wouldn't overpower the background audio. The first video snippet has a light flare effect on the lighter, while I'm showing it off. There is also a color grading on the video snippet in order to make it seem more intense. The second video snippet of the fire and snow also has a little bit of color grading in order to make the colors pop a bit.</p>
          <p>
            The background audio is a song by Emiljo A.C on soundcloud called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/emiljoacmusic/emiljo-ac-its-a-new-life">It's a new life</a>, I heard it while watching a streamer on twitch and just thought it was perfect. It is open to use and download for commercial purposes so that was a bonus.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really tried my best to make it so the transitions between the videos coincided with a part of the song, just to add to the flow of the video. Some places I should have probably cut down some of the video to make the flow even better, but I'm pretty happy with it overall anywho.
          </p>
          <!-- Another 500 words explaining your campaign idea -->
          <h2>The Campaign/Crowdfund idea</h2>
          <p>I was actually pretty stumped on what to make a video for. Originally I was thinking of maybe making a video for a piece of software I've been working on during my spare time. <a target="_blank" href="fyrespark.com">FyreSpark.com</a>.However, that idea was snuffed out quickly due to all the school work going on and the task of actually putting the project public and accessible, on top of ensuring I had enough working features to show was way too much of a daunting one. So instead, I was looking around my desk and just picked an item and ended up choosing a <em>BIC Lighter.</em> </p>
          <p>For the lighter campaign I wanted to show some of the functionalities and use cases of the lighter while keeping the video obviously as a spoof, lets face it, no one is going to want to crowdfund the use of a lighter. Anywho, I found some great <a href="https://soundcloud.com/emiljoacmusic/emiljo-ac-its-a-new-life">music</a> that was free to use as a background music and keeping with the sillyness, I just made the video to be super lighthearted.

          <p>I based the video around the idea that someone would want to possibly buy this `unique` lighter or give me money on a monthly basis to release videos of me using the lighter. Lets face it, people have done sillyer things on the internet...</p>
          <p>The only issue I really encountered is that I did find the final portion where I was talking to be a bit slow, I could have expanded on it a little by adding some floating text showing facts that I was saying withh some animations spice things up a bit. But I decided against it due to time restrictions. I honestly did not realize video editing takes so long todo! Overall I'm happy with my silly little video and learned a lot.</p>
