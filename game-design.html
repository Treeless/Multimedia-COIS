      <h2>The Idea</h2>
      <p>I thought creating a level in minecraft would be a bunch of fun, I ended up sinking 3 hours into the build above.</p>
      <p>I originally started off thinking I would make some sort of large castle with a village and a moat. But then changed my idea and decided to create a self sufficient underground bunker. I thought what would an underground bunker for a nuclear apocolypse need? I ended up thinking up:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A good solid front entrance</li>
        <li>Storeroom for materials and tools</li>
        <li>Food/Oxygen grow room</li>
        <li>Kitchen and Pantry</li>
        <li>Mess hall (where to eat)</li>
        <li>Sleeping Quarters</li>
        <li>Emergency Exit</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What I made</h2>
      <h3>Front Entrance</h3>
      <p>Starting with the front entrance, I wanted to make something cool that would be thought of as a proper bunker entrance. I thought about the sticky piston and redstone entrances I've seen on many youtube videos. I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXAUI6hXTTQ">this tutorial</a> and decided to use it to create a cool bunker entrance.</p>
      <div>
        <img width="45%" src="imgs/minecraft_piston_door_closed.PNG" />
        <img width="45%" src="imgs/minecraft_piston_door_open.PNG" />
      </div>
      <h3>Store Room &amp; Armoury</h3>
      <p>People would need to store essentials and tools somewhere. So I thought why not make a library/store room with an armoury in the back. This is the first room on your left when you walk into the bunker. A good spot for grabbing materials and items when going in and out of the bunker.</p>
      <div>
        <img width="45%" src="imgs/minecraft_storeroom.PNG" />
        <img width="45%" src="imgs/minecraft_armoury.PNG" />
      </div>
      <h3>Food/Oxygen Room</h3>
      <p>In a nuclear fallout situation, you would need to become totally self sufficient on growing your own food, and supplement oxygen production. Therefore on the right hand side of the bunker there is such a place for all your farming and breathing needs.</p>
      <div>
        <img width="80%" src="imgs/minecraft_growout.PNG" />
      </div>
      <h3>Kitchen / Mess Hall</h3>
      <p>You'd need a place to prepare and eat food, therefore I created a kitchen with a pantry, as well as a mess hall with "tables and chairs" where people could eat their meals.</p>
      <div>
        <img width="45%" src="imgs/minecraft_kitchen.PNG" />
        <img width="45%" src="imgs/minecraft_mess.PNG" />
      </div>
      <h3>Bedrooms</h3>
      <p>People would need a place to sleep, therefore I decided to make a long corridor of rooms. Each room containing a bed, chest and piece of art to keep the dwellers occupied ;)</p>
      <div>
        <img width="45%" src="imgs/minecraft_corridor.PNG" />
        <img width="45%" src="imgs/minecraft_bedroom.PNG" />
      </div>
      <h3>Emergency Exit &amp; The Docks</h3>
      <p>You always need to have a way to get out, in case the front of entrance is blocked. Therefore, I created a minecart escape route leading to a dock full of boats to get the dwellers to safety if the need arose.</p>
      <div>
        <img width="30%" src="imgs/minecraft_emerg.PNG" />
        <img width="30%" src="imgs/minecraft_minecarts.PNG" />
        <img width="30%" src="imgs/minecraft_docks.PNG" />
      </div>

      <h2>Additions or Changes I would have made</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Add - an Automated farming system using pistons. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGYuiMDPTjo">here</a></li>
        <li>Change - Make the emergency exit have a piston door as well, opening when a minecart drives near it</li>
        <li>Change -Finish more rooms and add games room</li>
        <li>Add - Archery room, for target practice</li>
        <li>Add - Livestock section</li>
        <li>Add - Make bunker, villager friendly. Have villagers start to move in.</li>
        <li>Change - I shouldn't have made the cave entrance originally. (wasn't useful)</li>
        <li>Change - Oh yeah, and I forgot to add a restroom ;)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The level design was fun and enlightening. I found it amazing what you can come up with when you base a level around a certain situation. You begin to think like a person living in that situation and its neat to see what you come up with. Sure, I could have added some more rooms from the many ideas I had, but these sort of levels can be endless. It's all up to your imagination.</p>
